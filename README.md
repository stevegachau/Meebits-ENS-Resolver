This ENS resolver contract allow you to automatically gift ALL Meebits holders a subdomain under your ENS name. 

Deploy the contract & add the contract address to your ENS Resolver record. From there, digit subdomains (such as "69.meebits.eth") will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the specific Meeb (i.e "Meebit #69")
